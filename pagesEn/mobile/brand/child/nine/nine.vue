        <!-- <h3>An international company with a family spirit</h3>
        <p>NINE UNITED is a privately held family of companies. The NINE UNITED family covers a range of different areas; design, architecture, inventory, branding, garment accessories, window decoration, CSR and sustainable development projects.</p>
        <p>In our everyday work, we aim to dream big and act humble, which is reflected in our approach to every new project.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The story of NINE UNITED began in 1975, in a small town called Ringkoebing on the western coast of Jutland when Troels Holch Povlsen founded the Danish clothing company BESTSELLER.</p>
        <p>As BESTSELLER grew, new areas were explored and new business opportunities started developing. The NINE UNITED family began to take shape in the early 2000s and is still growing every day. The family blood and values still run through both BESTSELLER and NINE UNITED, and this shared legacy is an important part of the NINE UNITED history and spirit.</p> -->
        <h3 class="brand-our">An international company with a family spirit</h3>
        <p>We dream big and work hard, but it is our ability to think and act as a team that unites us across borders, brands and departments. We are a privately held family of international companies covering a range of different areas, including design furniture and lighting, health and care products, retail branding, property administration, foundations and social investment.</p>
        <h3 class="brand-our">Run by heart</h3>
        <p>Great results are made by people who care. We can train people for a job, but we cannot easily train someone to care about what they do for a living.<br><br>Since 1975, members of the Nine United family have been guided by one philosophy based on 10 basic principles. Our cooperation is built on trust, partnership and honesty. We treat all people as individuals but we think and act as a team.</p>
        <h3 class="brand-our">Part of Nine United Family</h3>
