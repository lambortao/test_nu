    <h3>Social Responsibility <br>& Sustainablity</h3>
    <p>– Our collection is designed to be passed down through generations, to endure the impact of time, focusing on quality over quantity. Social responsibility and sustainablity play a large part in that process, and we are happy to share our procedures and results.</p>

    <h3>MATERIALS THAT MATTER</h3>
    <p>We allocate a lot of resources to supporting a circular use of materials; from sourcing sustainable leathers and sheepskin, using Responsible Down Standard (RDS) feathers, eliminating all toxic chemicals, and stepping up our recycling game, to improving our use of sustainably sourced FSC® certified wood, EU Ecolabel products and Oeko-Tex® certified materials.</p>

    <h3>BUILT TO LAST</h3>
    <p>Since 2010, &Tradition has worked in collaboration with Scandinavian and international designers with the ambition of creating quality furniture and accessories, focusing on timeless appeal and a ‘built to last’ mentality. By marrying tradition with innovation, &Tradition’s collection ranges from modern masterpieces to reissued Danish classics that we are thrilled to bring into contemporary homes and spaces.</p>
    <p>Sustainability is part of our every day; it informs our decision-making, our processes, our designs and our work ethic. It is something we take seriously, and we understand that we have a responsibility to limit the impact of our designs and a duty to work towards a more sustainable future. We are more aware than ever of the impact our industry has on local and global communities, and we freely admit that we will never be perfect. However, we strive to reduce our ecological footprint even further, and we are committed to creating sustainable and ethically sourced, long-lasting design pieces that will bring joy for many years to come.</p>

    <h3>OUR JOURNEY TO SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
    <p>At &Tradition, the entire design process is scrutinized from start to finish – How can we improve the materials here? Where is this wood sourced from? Which chemicals have been used on this fabric? How will this product be packaged? We pay attention every step of the way, and we are constantly researching, experimenting and testing new ways of sourcing, producing and manufacturing the designs you see today. For us, it’s important to know where our materials come from, and how they have been treated. And we wish to be open about it.</p>
    <p>Our collection makes use of a multitude of natural and man-made materials, ranging from woods, metals and plastics, to hides and feathers, to textiles and foams. It’s a lot to think about – but for us, providing the highest quality products to our customers is paramount to who we are as a company. We work with natural materials such as walnut, which comes in a range of strong and rich hues and can easily be shaped into elaborate forms and polished to a smooth finishing; as well as marble and travertine, both highly resistant and durable; whilst organic materials are sourced for our home objects, ensuring longevity.</p>
    <p>We are not your run-of-the-mill, one-time use design company – our collection is designed to be passed down through generations, to endure the impact of time, focusing on quality over quantity. ‘Built to last’ isn’t just something we thought sounded great, it’s the mantra that informs our decisions from start to finish. Being knowledgeable about where our materials are sourced from is important and we make sure to keep up-to-date with the latest findings and details.</p>

    <h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
    <p>Our journey towards sustainablity is an ongoing process, and by working with like-minded designers and artists we will do our upmost to ensure that our processes keep on progressing towards minimizing the environmental impact of our collection.</p>
