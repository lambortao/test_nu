    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <p>We continuously strive to offer a collection of beautiful and high quality products with timeless appeal that transcends trends and remain relevant for generations to come.</p>
    <p>We always source the materials best suited to ensure the integrity of the product – in terms of aesthetics, quality and cost. We introduce recyclable materials when possible and strive to develop solutions for easy assembly and disassembly – making it possible to replace and ultimately dispose damaged parts properly.</p>

    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>We are committed to honoring the heritage of Verner Panton and will never compromise on quality, design or originality. Sourcing materials that fulfills our promise while minimizing the negative impact to the environment is a constant journey, and we still have a long way ahead of us.</p>
    <p>Our commitment to be more sustainable includes efforts towards improving the design process, manufacturing, packaging and shipping. We continuously work to find new ways of designing and producing our products, focusing on approved and sustainable materials.</p>

    <h3>Recyclable PE & PP</h3>
    <p>Plastic materials represents a large part of Panton’s design heritage and also plays a big part of the Verpan collection. When handled responsibly, plastic can function as a sustainably responsible choice, as it is a very durable material that ensures a long product life. Whenever possible, we implement recyclable PP and PE, ensuring that products at end-of-life can be granulated and reused.</p>

    <h3>FSC-Certified Wood</h3>
    <p>Wood is used throughout our collection and we strive to implement wood from sustainable and traceable forestry. For the majority of our collection, including loved products such as the Cloverleaf Sofa, Series 430, Welle and more, we have already introduced FSC® Certified wood.</p>
    <p>FSC is a global non-profit forest certification system promoting the responsible management of the world’s forests, protecting them for future generations. The organization works against deforestation, protects animals and plants, and ensures that foresters receive decent wages, proper training and safety equipment.</p>

    <h3>Packaging</h3>
    <p>Packaging represents a significant part of our footprint and we continuously work to implement better and more sustainable solutions. However, first priority is always to protect the product and minimize the risk of damage. Secondly, we focus on minimizing packaging and avoiding unnecessary plastic components.</p>
